## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While developing the app, most problems I faced occured when setting up Android Studio. These were mostly due to version numbers being out of sync. Aside from that, I was able to follow along with the tutorial most of the time, but when I didn't see one line my whole app stopped fuctioning.
